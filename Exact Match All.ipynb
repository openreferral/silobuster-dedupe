Intake teams consisting of a public health nurse and family staff liaison provide in-home developmental screening, resource identification and referral. \\xa0Children are also assessed by a developmental pediatrician and a team of qualified therapists and teachers. \\xa0Teams comprised of a physical and occupational therapist, a speech pathologist, and a certified special education teacher coordinate the child’s treatment program. This unique team approach is of maximum benefit to a child, as the four disciplines work to complement one another. \\xa0Program options include: \\xa0individual therapy, toddler groups, preschool groups and home-based services. For those who qualify, a transportation program is available to transfer children to and from the toddler and preschool programs. \\xa0Children may be referred to the SGS by a physician or by self-referral. \\xa0Parents are an integral part of successful treatment and must agree to take an active role in their child’s program. \\xa0Each year, over 200 children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, spina bifida, hearing or vision impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury (shaken babies) and other forms of developmental delays and rare syndromes, are all served without regard to race, gender, religion or ability to pay.\"},\n",

We offer free 40-minute consultations on a broad range of issues. Students can also hire us for ongoing representation for a low hourly rate. UW Student Legal Services can assist only currently enrolled UW-Seattle and UW-Bothell students (undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree-seeking) who have paid the Services & Activities Fee as part of their tuition. If you are not enrolled for the current quarter but you were enrolled last quarter and you intend to enroll next quarter, then you are still eligible for our services. Newly admitted students are currently enrolled once they have registered and are taking classes. SLS does not serve UW Tacoma students at this time, and cannot represent a student when the opposing party is another UW-Seattle or Bothell student or UW entity.Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our office is operating under a hybrid model. Students can choose to have their consultation over Zoom or in-person (following all HUB COVID-19 safety procedures including masking at all times).

Intake teams consisting of a public health nurse and family staff liaison provide in-home developmental screening, resource identification and referral. \\xa0Children are also assessed by a developmental pediatrician and a team of qualified therapists and teachers. \\xa0Teams comprised of a physical and occupational therapist, a speech pathologist, and a certified special education teacher coordinate the child’s treatment program. This unique team approach is of maximum benefit to a child, as the four disciplines work to complement one another. \\xa0Program options include: \\xa0individual therapy, toddler groups, preschool groups and home-based services. For those who qualify, a transportation program is available to transfer children to and from the toddler and preschool programs. \\xa0Children may be referred to the SGS by a physician or by self-referral. \\xa0Parents are an integral part of successful treatment and must agree to take an active role in their child’s program. \\xa0Each year, over 200 children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, spina bifida, hearing or vision impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury (shaken babies) and other forms of developmental delays and rare syndromes, are all served without regard to race, gender, religion or ability to pay.\"},\n",

If you are not enrolled for the current quarter but you were enrolled last quarter and you intend to enroll next quarter, then you are still eligible for our services. Newly admitted students are currently enrolled once they have registered and are taking classes. SLS does not serve UW Tacoma students at this time, and cannot represent a student when the opposing party is another UW-Seattle or Bothell student or UW entity.Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our office is operating under a hybrid model.
